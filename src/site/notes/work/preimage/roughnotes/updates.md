Fri Sep 13
- mainly spent my time working on and perfecting the react unity wrapper
- tested it, collaborated with Arvind on multiple changes in both react and unity
- tested and integrated an instructional splash screen when unity loads
- the splash screen does come up and then is unloaded as soon as it is clicked but I'm modifying it to make sure we can show it up again if the user wants, say as a button on the toolbar
- the splash screen also has some options from usBim's interface like zoom button etc. which we don't have, so was fixing that
- worked on fixing the uppy progress issue, no real progress on
