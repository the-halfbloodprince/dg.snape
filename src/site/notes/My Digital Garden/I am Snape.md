### Hey there üëã

I'm Manish, a Full Stack Software Developer with interest and experience in creating immersive, accessible and performant web applications.

### What is this? üìë

I'm currently not actively working on creating my portfolio site. When I do it, I wanna do one that I am really proud of (doesn't necessarily mean super complex or fascinating, just a good one not very much like anyone else's). Till then, I'm using a temporary Obsidian Note and publishing it using Digital Garden (https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) to do the job. I also document stuff I learn as well here. There's still a lot to update in this page as well, but I hope you'll find what you're looking for somewhere here.
